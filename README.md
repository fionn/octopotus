OCTOPOTUS
=========

This is my Twitter bot, [@octopotus](https://twitter.com/octopotus). He currently lives on an EC2 instance because [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) uses `htmllib` rather than `urllib`, so he gets stuck behind proxys. Let me know if you have any ideas on how to fix that.

Thanks, Octopus!
